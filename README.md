================================

This solution has been created for being run at a node.js platform. It doens't use any further library than those that come with a standard node.js version 0.10.x installation.

The code and the documents were written using Sublime Text 2 Trial Version. Tests have been performed using a Terminal window on Mac OS 10.6.8 in English, and Google Chrome was the browser used to test the service. 

Further information can be found at the solution architecture.txt file.
